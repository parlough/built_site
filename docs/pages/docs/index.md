built_site is a fast and powerful static site generator built with Dart's build system.
Build tools like [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) or
[webdev](https://pub.dev/packages/webdev) enable fast and incremental rebuilds that are
still guaranteed to be correct.

built_site contains a powerful template engine and a set of builders designed to integrate
well with Dart's build system.
It is fairly unopinionated, giving you a lot of flexibility in how you design your website
or themes.
built_site has been designed to enable very small and incremental rebuilds. Together with
webdev and auto-reloads, it is a great tool to write static websites.
